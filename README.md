# Next.js 404 Error with Link Component

This repository demonstrates a common but perplexing issue in Next.js: a 404 error when using the built-in `Link` component for navigation, even when the target page exists and the path is correct.

## Problem Description
The application contains two pages: `index.js` (home) and `about.js` (about).  Navigating from `index.js` to `about.js` using the `Link` component results in a 404 error.  The `about.js` file is correctly located within the `pages` directory, and the route in the `Link` component is accurate.

## Solution
The solution to this issue often involves ensuring the `about.js` file is correctly named and placed within the `pages` directory, and that the `Link` component's `href` prop is correctly specified.  Additional considerations include the project's file structure and the presence of any conflicting routing rules.  In this specific example, the error was resolved by double-checking the `about.js` file location and the `href` attribute.
